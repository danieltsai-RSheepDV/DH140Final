# Digital Humanities 140:  - Summer 2024

The goal of this project is to find the trends in triple A and indie games over time to see how sentiment has shifted with the rise of indie creators and growing disdain toward triple A companies. Some of the aspects I'll be focusing on is the change in ratings over time, the changes in reviewer sentiment over time, and changes in player count.

**The python notebook file for this project is [SteamAnalysis.ipynb](https://github.com/danieltsai-RSheepDV/DH140Final/blob/master/SteamAnalysis.ipynb) in the root directory on the master branch.**

## Inspirations

The article [The Era of the Indie Game](https://www.konvoy.vc/content/the-era-of-the-indie-game) was interesting to me as it showed concrete data that indie games were not only becoming more popular, but also starting to match triple A games in terms of quality, rating, and sales.

![Graph of Sales](https://i0.wp.com/quanticfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/steam_tags_med_res.png?resize=650%2C650&ssl=1)

The above visualization shows the connection between different tags in Steam games, connections being formed when games have both tags at once. I want to be able to do the same though with additional separation for indie vs AAA games and have the size of points be representative of different stats, such as revenue, ratings, and sales.

The humanities topic I wanted to explore is Sociology, tracking the trends of the gaming community's sentiment over time.

The following articles were used to determine possible research topics.
1. [The Psychological Perspective on Game Design](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-psychological-perspective-on-game-design)
2. [Game Design Psychology: Unlock Player Motivation | LU](https://online.lindenwood.edu/blog/the-fascinating-world-of-game-design-psychology-unlocking-the-secrets-to-player-motivation/)
3. [Can Psychologists be helpful to game design?](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1aw1jlh/can_psychologists_be_helpful_to_game_design/)
4. [Want To Be A Game Psychologist? What You Need to Know](https://www.nirandfar.com/understanding-the-psychology-behind-game-design/)
