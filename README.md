# Preamble

The goal of this project is to find the trends in triple A and indie games over time to see how sentiment has shifted with the rise of indie creators and growing disdain toward triple A companies. The dataset I'll be using is [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset/data).

The article [The Era of the Indie Game](https://www.konvoy.vc/content/the-era-of-the-indie-game) was interesting to me as it showed concrete data that indie games were not only becoming more popular, but also starting to match triple A games in terms of quality, rating, and sales.

## Inspirations

![Graph of Sales](https://i0.wp.com/quanticfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/steam_tags_med_res.png?ssl=1)

The above visualization shows the connection between different tags in Steam gamees, connections being formed when games have both tags at once. I want to be able to do the same though with additional seperation for indie vs AAA games and have the size of points be representative of different stats, such as revenue, ratings, and sales.

The main topics I want to explore are:
- Psychology
- Sociology
- Gender Studies

With some of these articles being possible research topics.
